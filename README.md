## OpenCannabis for Python
[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/7cd07a27722c5e8b59862ee570c3caf2d4a6dfbdec7a982b7e.svg)](https://buildkite.com/opencannabis/python) ![Code Climate maintainability](https://img.shields.io/codeclimate/maintainability/OpenCannabis/Python?label=quality) ![Codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/OpenCannabis/Python) ![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/opencannabis)

**Latest Release**: `1.0.1`

This codebase provides the canonical Python module for leveraging [OpenCannabis](https://github.com/OpenCannabis)-formatted data. Using objects in this module, one can seamlessly decode or encode OCS-compliant data in text, binary, and JSON formats.

### Installation

To install this package, simply:
```text
pip install opencannabis
```

Or, in a `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
echo "opencannabis==1.0.0" >> requirements.txt && pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Tested with Python 3, and theoretically supports Python 2 (let us know, we can fix it if you encounter issues!).

### Using the objects

Objects from the [OpenCannabis Specification](https://github.com/OpenCannabis/RFC) and
[Protocol Definitions](https://github.com/OpenCannabis/Protocol) can be imported in Python and used to express data in
OCS format. Protocol buffer objects are capable of producing (1) proto text format, (2) binary proto format, or (3)
JSON.

For example, here's some code that prepares a product key:
```python
from google.protobuf import json_format
from opencannabis.base.ProductKey_pb2 import ProductKey
from opencannabis.base.ProductKind_pb2 import ProductKind

key = ProductKey()
key.id = "abc123"
key.type = ProductKind.EDIBLES

# encode into spec-compliant JSON
json_format.MessageToJson(x)

'{\n  "id": "abc123",\n  "type": "EDIBLES"\n}'
```

See the [Protobuf docs for Python](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial) for more info and
code samples.

### Tooling

Development happens through the `Makefile`, which calls [Bazel](https://bazel.build). The library is assembled by
sandboxed workers, then built with `setuptools` into various distributions. Invoking `make help` reveals local commands
intended for development:
```text
ocpy / 1.0.0:

all                            Build and test the SDK.
build                          Build the Python SDK for OpenCannabis.
clean                          Remove built artifacts (safe to run with codebase changes).
coverage                       Generate a unified coverage report. Typically run in CI and requires grcov.
help                           Show this help text.
prompt                         Run an interactive prompt with the build SDK.
publish                        Publish release artifacts (assuming requisite permissions).
release                        Build release artifacts for the library, and re-render codebase docs.
render-tpl                     Render templates for help materials, such as the main README.
report-coverage                Report coverage results to Codecov.
test                           Run unit tests for the SDK.
```
